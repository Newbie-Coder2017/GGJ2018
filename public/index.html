    <h1>Space Colonies</h1>
    <p>It’s the year 2100. For hundreds of years, humans have ignored the warnings given to them by mother nature. There were rising temperatures in the coldest regions, and sub-freezing temperatures in deserts. Sea levels rose all over the coastal cities, submerging major metropolitans, while the west coast was left dry. After years of trying to combat the repercussions dealt to us by mother nature, the human race has finally lost the battle.  Earth has been left uninhabitable. Your mission, is to colonize other planets in the galaxy, and maintain contact with the human race by placing satellites near the newly colonized planets. It’s a dangerous place out there!</p>
